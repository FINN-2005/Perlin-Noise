# PerlinNoiseVisualizer

Mathematical implementation and visualization of 1D and 2D Perlin noise using Python and Pygame.

## Description

This project demonstrates the mathematical foundation and graphical rendering of Perlin noise in one and two dimensions. It contains clean Python implementations along with visualization scripts using Pygame, showing the core interpolation and gradient computations that form Perlin noise. The project is designed for educational use, algorithm exploration, and procedural noise experimentation.

```main.py``` is the file containing the final Perlin Noise function(2D).

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/FINN-2005/pygame_template.git
```

## Usage

```python
# You`re free to explore on your Own! :)
```
